URGENT UPDATE! As of January 5th, 2022 AT\u0026T has retired their Pay-As-You-Go plans. It is no longer possible to sign up as a new customer with these plans. For a discussion on the matter. This post will remain up for archival purposes. Introduction Do you want to use AT\u0026T service but don’t want to forgo your life savings in exchange? I am here to tell you that you don’t have to. AT\u0026T has long offered affordable Pay-As-You-Go plans in addition to their normal monthly plans. With the advent of the “Unlimited Everything” way of selling service in the USA, Pay-As-You-Go plans across all Carriers have diminished. This has not deterred AT\u0026T from continuing to offer these plans as many still rely on their service. $2 Daily Plan 25¢ Minute Plan In this post I’m going to go over everything you need to know about the AT\u0026T Pay-As-You-Go plans and how to activate them.

You only pay for what you use and in its prepaid iteration you must have the available funds before you use them. Each call, text, and other billable activities have their own “fee” which gets deducted from from your balance that you previously funded. If there are no funds, there is no service. Refill Requirements are imposed to keep the account active and profitable for the Carrier. This is done by placing a limit on how much time certain refill amounts can fund an account for. The more the refill amount the more time the account is allowed to be active. Rollover is a concept that means, what you don’t use gets rolled over to the next cycle. There are 2 types of rollover that can exist in prepaid Pay-As-You-Go plans. The first is balance rollover where so long as you fulfill the refill requirements then your balance will rollover, and be added to your total account balance. The second type of rollover is usage rollover, where if you don’t use some item that you already paid for, then that item gets rolled over into the next cycle. All these concepts exist in AT\u0026T’s two plans to some degree. Let’s get into the details now.

How this works, is that refill amounts can only fund the account for up-to a certain amount of time. $10-$24 - 30 Days $25-$99 - 90 Days $100-$500? - 365 Days Adding funds to your account adds time from the date you added the funds. It does not extend the time you have left. Example - if you still had 15 days left, and you add $10 today. You will now have 30 days of service going forward. You will not have 45 days.

It used to be the case that all you needed to do is pop the SIM card into the phone, dial an activation code, and you were up and running in 5-10 minutes. This method has been used by myself for as long as I can remember. I think the last time I activated this was was in early 2020, maybe late 2019. No internet connection required, no second device, it used to be so easy. The good old days. Now… AT\u0026T wants you to input your IMEI during the activation process to verify compatibility with its network. Not the end of the world but it makes the activation more of a headache than required. Oh well… no sense pouting, lets continue with the methods that work right now. As it is AT\u0026T, there are still multiple ways to activate. Some methods to directly activate the plans without any workarounds include Calling AT\u0026T Customer Service - This requires having a way to call them as the SIM cannot dial 611 without service. Some agents are more helpful and knowledgeable than others, it may require a few attempts to get an agent who knows what they are doing and actually opens the account properly. Activating at a Corporate AT\u0026T Store - They should still be able to activate these plans, technically speaking. I can report success in a corporate store in activating the 25¢ Minute Plan, I just did it the other day. The sales-person may not be aware of existence of these plans and may not be to keen to help. Insist the plan is an option on their iPads, it’s there. They may not have ever activated the plan themselves, this is okay as once they find the plan on their iPad it becomes a standard activation. What about non-corporate stores you might be thinking? Good luck… that’s all I’ll say about that. Lets move on to some other ways of activating the plans. The other ways to activate the Pay-As-You-Go plans utilize the “Downgrade Method”.

Any Single Line AT\u0026T Prepaid plan can be converted to another in quick and easy fashion. From what I’ve experienced, it is easier to downgrade from a monthly plan to a Pay-As-You-Go plan, rather than activate those plans straight out. I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking, “Great, so this guy is saying I have to pay for a monthly plan and then downgrade to paygo plan… what does he think, that I’m made of money?\" No… and neither am I. Which reminds me, that if by the end of this guide you have benefited at all and feel compelled to do so, please consider a small contribution. I work on this site as a 1-man hobby project. Anyway… back to the guide! When an AT\u0026T Prepaid account is first activated it must complete 2 major steps. The first step is - Opening the account This is where IMEI Verification and choosing a plan occurs. This step always comes first, and you cannot continue forward without completing this step. The second step is - Funding the account This is where you have to actually pay for the plan that you chose in step one. Once this occurs, your account is alive and active. BUT… An AT\u0026T Prepaid Account can exist in a state of limbo for a period of time. It is possible to complete step 1 without completing step 2. During this state of limbo, you are given a phone number and can create an online login for your account. Once you have your AT\u0026T number… you have an account and can receive help and preform standard account actions like any other AT\u0026T Prepaid customer. This includes “downgrading” the plan you chose in step 1 to any other plan. Either from the online dashboard or through customer service. This is not a glitch or hack, it is like this by design, and has been like this for as long as I can remember. AT\u0026T wants your money, and they are giving you time to fund your account. They keep the account in this state for I think… 30 days. Don’t quote me on this though, I truly don’t know. But it is enough time to arrange a payment for your newly created account. I think the longest I kept an account in limbo was probably 2 days. Once you have downgraded your plan to a Pay-As-You-Go plan, you would then proceed with funding your account by credit/debit or PIN code. You should now have fully activated service. That’s the “Downgrade Method” in a nutshell. Anyway… The following methods are self-service and utilize the “Downgrade Method” Calling The Automated Activation Service This method allows you to complete step 1 without requiring you to finish with step 2. You can choose literally any monthly plan and then proceed with the “Downgrade Method”. Using The Online Activation Portal This method will also allow you to complete step 1 without requiring you to finish with step 2. Same process as above, choose any plan and proceed with the “Downgrade Method”.

A lot of older phones and international models are being rejected by AT\u0026T. Make sure the phone you use for activation is supported. Look at this whitelist for supported phones on AT\u0026T. I expect this list to be outdated pretty quickly so don’t consider it the end-all-be-all. Unfortunately AT\u0026T’s does NOT have an IMEI checker to verify compatibility. This mostly applies to non-iPhones, if you have a recent iPhone (after iPhone 6) you should be good. There is a method to verify your IMEI with AT\u0026T’s online activation portal, though you will need a valid non-activated SIM card to check. So for our purposes, I would recommend acquiring a SIM card first, run your IMEI, and if all good… then purchase your refill card (does not apply if you’re using credit/debit). If you want to check your phone then read a little further and complete only step 1 of the activation as that will tell you if your phone is supported. Practically a mock or trial activation before the real thing.

I walked you through activation and a quick run down of the rates and features. Kind of a shame that AT\u0026T no longer promotes these plans as I think many people can benefit from them. Oh well, I am happy to be able to share this information with you all. Which plan did you end up activating? – This thing of ours… Share the article if you liked it!
