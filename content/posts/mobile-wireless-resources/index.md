{{% admonition info "Disclaimer" false %}}
No one has sponsered me nor paid me for inclusion or exlusion on this page.

None of the links on this page are affiliate links, though there are links that lead to pages that do contain affilate links. 

These are all direct links to the external sites. I have only cleaned up links to make them somewhat human readible. All links redirect to HTTPS where possible.

Some resources are excluded because the main content is obstructed by *too many* ads and/or sponsered content and as a result it confuses people directed there. 

Also if the site does anything to give *too much* of a poor user expierience then that may also play a part in exclusion. Some examples could be "poorly coded",  "outdated", "broken links", "spam redirects", "loading time unreasonably long", etc. You get the idea.

My site, Lyroma.com is also represented, a one-man hobby site. I hardly have any content on my site. I don't claim to be impartial nor for that matter partial. I don't currently generate any revenue of any kind from this site. If that changes then I'll change my tune and be more clear.

## **How To Get Started With This Page**

This page is a collection of links gathered from around the web to make these great resources from various sites available on one resource page. I won't take up space on this page with a long exposition. 

The pricing and discounts sections will be on top as I expect those to be the most popular links. Use the Table of Contents to skip to the section you want.

Please visit this following page if you are a beginner in this space and would like some hand-holding through this resource page.

*   [Lyroma.com/resource-guide](https://lyroma.com/resource-guide)

I will be adding more resources, as well as ensuring that all the links stay updated, so check back often!
