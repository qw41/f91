# How to Buy a SIM Card at the Airport in the USA

## Introduction
In this article/guide, there will be information about everything anyone would need to know about buying and activating a SIM card with full working service at an airport in the United States for usage in the United States. Finding, buying, and activating will all be covered here.

At the time of the initial posting date (September 27, 2021), there are ZERO correct, current, English language guides written by anyone on how to do this. Incorrect information has been spread for at least 3 years and perhaps longer. There is no other recourse than to write this article/guide here and now to rectify this. 

The trend seems to be that if anyone asks about purchasing SIM cards at the airport, SPECIFICALLY in the USA, the response will be that it is either "not possible", "prohibitively expensive", "better options outside the airport", or "not enough demand". Every single one of these claims are incorrect, not only have new options arrived but there has been a convenient and affordable option for years. Buying and activating a SIM card at the airport is THE MOST CONVENIENT option when arriving at any country, aside from having a SIM card with roaming features before you beforehand . 

The issue is when people ask this question the people who answer the question are mostly those who have never tried, never had a reason, and will never have a reason to do so. This topic warranted its own [article](https://librecell.com/blog/Why-You-Should-NOT-Ask-a-Local-American-How-to-Buy-a-Local-USA-SIM-Card-Period) about why a visitor to the USA should NOT ask local Americans how to purchase any SIM card from anywhere in the USA (PERIOD). Spoiler... if you do not want to read the article, most local Americans have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to this subject. The demand for this service is there, as it is there for virtually every other country in the world outside the USA. 

Time to get to the information you came here for. There are currently, at least, 3 specific locations in airports that sell cellular service. Options 1 and 2 covered will explain why most people should NOT rely and COUNT ON on them to purchase cellular service at the airport. The last and 3rd option is not like options 1 and 2 and is the reason for writing this article.

## 1. Currency Exchange Booths
![Currency Exchange Booth at IAH Airport in HOUSTON TEXAS](/img/)

A quick rundown
1. Inconsistent hours open and ACTUALLY staffed
2. Inconsistent prices
3. Inconsistent choices
4. Inconsistent inventory on hand
5. Inconsistent customer service (putting it nicely)

As you can see if you do run into one of these that is indeed staffed when you walk up to it, have a SIM card in stock, at an acceptable price, and the customer service is even aware that they sell them, it might be a good option. You should buy a lottery ticket immediately afterwards. 

The worst part is when the people working these booths say they do not have/sell any SIM cards and you ask if they know of anywhere in the airport that does. If you read the article linked in the beginning about why a visitor to the USA should NOT ask local Americans how to buy a SIM card then you already know the answer.

## 2. Vending Machines/Kiosks

The  options that seem to be at most airports are vending machines provided by Best Buy and Skyroam. 

### [Best Buy](https://bestbuy.com)

When it comes to these machines selling SIM cards, it seems that it is hit or miss, leaning towards not having them. There is photographic evidence of these machines stocking SIM cards from T-Mobile, H2O Wireless, SIMTraveler.com, and some other brands to blurry to tell definitively. They have also stocked Virgin Mobile prepaid phones and H2O mobile hotspots. An international calling card also it seems. Those are all from the past though with the some of these photos and videos going back 10+ years. The latest photo seems to be from this one, it is from an online review, posted October, 2018, here by Mark ------, it is selling a T-Mobile Tourist SIM card for $30. That specific SIM has only been offered since June 2016. IAH and LAX . A way to check the inventory at any given kiosk is unknown at this time, most likely unable to so. So the Best Buy kiosks have sold them and may still carry SIMs from time to time but they are inconsistant.

### [Skyroam](https://skyroam.com)
![Skyroam Mobile Hotspot Kiosk in IAH Airport Houston](/img/iahskyroam1.jpg)
This company provides wireless hotspots/mofis for rent and purchase. There is no way to order service for a phone or other devices besides the companies own hardware. No SIM cards are offered as a standalone product. To find a find a location worldwide click here.

### [Straight Talk](https://straighttalk.com)
![Straight Talk Kiosk Somewhere](/img/straighttalkkiosk1.jpg)
Straight Talk put out a [blog post](https://blog.straighttalk.com/straight-talk-automated-retail-shops/) about these kiosks in 2013, there have been reports of sightings. Nothing in the past 5 years it seems. It is unknown if these have been dicontinued. 

### [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com)
![Google Fi SIM Card Vending Machine in JFK Airport New York](/img/jfkgooglefi.jpg)
The reported sightings of these machines are more recent. There is no list of locations nor is there any public anknowdgement by Google that these machines exist. Unreliable at this moment.

### Other Local Small Business's That Sell SIM Cards
These seem to exist in some capacity in the USA. Products offered, customer service, price, and locations available, can all range from really bad to really good. The website of the airport might list some of these stores in their shopping list. It seems to be the best way of finding out if an airport has a certain store in it.

Example 1 -
![SIMs On The Go in Newark Airport New Jersey](/img/SIMsonthego.jpg)
The Newark airport in New Jersey lists a kiosk named ["SIMs On The Go"](https://www.jfkshopdine.com/directory/cell-phone-SIMs-on-the-go-jfk-terminal-8-t8/). It is listed as "temporarily closed". Running that name in a online search engine yields little relevant results. No website, no hours of business, no contact phone number, nothing.

Example 2 -
![Virgin Mobile/Boost Mobile in LAX Airport Los Angeles](/img/vgbm.jpg)
The LAX airport in Los Angeles lists a ["Virgin Mobile/Boost Mobile"](https://www.flylax.com/lax-dining-and-shopping-details?id=d4d8c048-1757-4848-8c28-ea1bf0745b09) kiosk, also "temporarily closed". They have listed hours and a contact phone number though.

Example 3 -
![SIM Cards - Vending in McCarren Airport Las Vegas](/img/newarkSIMvending.jpg)
The McCarren Airport in Las Vegas lists a ["SIM Cards - Vending"](https://www.mccarran.com/Maps) (type in "SIM cards" in the search bar and it should appear) vending machine. The only thing known about this vending machine from the listing is the specific location in the airport in which it is located. Nothing more.

## So Far You Have Learned...
That the currency exchange booths and any kind of vending machine/kiosk should not be counted on if you actually want to purchase a SIM card at the airport in the USA. Backup options, at best, is what they should be considered, and even then. The issue is NOT that, there is not one entity that does not provide a uniform expierence all around it. There are airports elsewhere in the world where a
Uniformity helps a person prepare and know in advance what kind of expierence they will encounter

## 3. Inmotion Stores USA

![Inmotion Store in IAH George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston](/img/inmotioniahmain.jpg)
From at least [March 13th, 2018](https://www.inmotionstores.com/post/what-you-need-to-know-about-traveling-and-SIM-cards) and perhaps even earlier, Inmotion has been selling an affordable option at US airports with Ultra Mobile SIM Cards. On [March 22, 2018](https://www.inmotionstores.com/post/inmotion-wins-coveted-award-for-industry-excellence-at-airport-revenue-news) they reported that they had "125 locations throughout the United States". At the time of the initial posting of this article, according to [inmotion](https://www.inmotionstores.com/about) they currently have "120+ stores, including InMotion, Soundbalance, Headphone Hub, and iStore (Minneapolis only)". These stores have not been in and are not in some random random airports either, they are predominently in airports most frequented by travelers on both international and domestic flights. They include airports in 27 states and Washington DC.

Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming, and any overseas territory.

These exclusions are quite impactful especially to a few notable locations, just naming a few that come to mind are
Las Vegas
Anywhere in Hawaii
Any of the overseas territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands)

This article is NOT going to cover any of these excluded locations.

Inmotion having locations in only 27 out of 50 states might sound like they are not a viable option, but if you take a look at the images below you will see why that is misguided notion.




This article has always been about what is most accessible to the maximum amount people. Inmotion stores at the current moment have everything that the other 2 locations are lacking

On Jan 13, 2021 SIM Local announced a partnership with InMotion to bring SIM Local SIM Cards into InMotion Stores. In the press release they said they would "offer [thier] products from January 2021"
Products as in plural. SIM Local is a UK company and partners with UK carriers to provide thier SIM cards through their outlets. Lycamobile and Truphone are only 2 whose brand names extend offerings to U.S.A customers. Lycamobile through their subsideary Lycamobile USA and Truphone through its business offerings and prepaid
