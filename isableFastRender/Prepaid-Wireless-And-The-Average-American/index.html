<p>Visiting the USA and looking for information about the Prepaid Wireless Market. SIM Cards, where, how, who, what, why. It would benefit someone visiting the USA to have a little knowledge about this topic.
Want a quick breakdown? Read on.</p>
<h2 id="the-us-cellular-market-quickly-summarized">The US Cellular Market Quickly Summarized</h2>
<p><em>All numbers given are rounded out. Close enough to present the point being given.</em></p>
<p>There are currently 3 Major Nationwide Mobile Network Operators (MNO&rsquo;s).</p>
<ol>
<li>Verizon - 170 Million Subscribers</li>
<li>AT&amp;T - 120 Million Subscribers</li>
<li>T-Mobile/Sprint - 100 Million Subscribers</li>
</ol>
<p>They are the &ldquo;Big 3&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="details admonition failure">
        <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
            <i class="icon fas fa-times-circle fa-fw"></i>Irrelevant 4th Mobile Network Operator<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content">There is also some pygmy thing over there at Dish. Completely irrelevant as its own MNO as of this posting date.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
<p>There are roughly 330 Million people who live in the USA. Simple math says that these 3 carriers dominate the US market. Every other carrier operating in the country is miniscule in terms of subscriber count compared to the Big 3 listed above. The Big 3 are full service and provide everything from phone purchasing, cellular service, insurance, customer service, repair services and more. They not only provide service to individual customers, but they also dominate the government and business customer market. They are the one and only to most people/organizations.</p>
<p>Even with the fact that the Big 3 dominate the market, there is more than enough profit to be had to warrant the nearly 100+ reseller/independent carriers operating in the country. These are the companies that most Americans might recognize the names of 3 or 4, maximum, out of 100+. This is where major savings could be had in the USA cellular market.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-majority-of-americans-purchase-their-cellular-servicephones">How the Majority of Americans Purchase Their Cellular Service/Phones</h2>
<p>The majority of Americans purchase their phone and service from one of the Big 3. The phone is usually purchased on a multi-year payment plan or lease, so they must stay with said carrier till the term is complete, at least if purchasing through one of the Big 3. Others will finance their phone through some other lending vehicle. When the term is complete they will do one of few things but the end result, usually, is continuing being a subscriber of one the Big 3.</p>
<p>Another aspect is most people will make their purchases at some sort of local retail store where the employees with set up everything for the customer, full service. The majority will stay with one of the Big 3 for multiple years and if they do ever change carriers it is usually to one of the other of the Big 3 carriers, where they will likely stay for multiple years. This is what the majority have done and continue to do every day.</p>
<h2 id="1-phone--1-phone-number">1 Phone = 1 Phone Number</h2>
<p>Most people have 1 phone. That 1 phone equals 1 phone number. Some will have a personal cell phone number and business phone number. Some accomplish this by having 2 phones, others, likely have a VoIP solution of some kind. Phones with dual SIMs or a phone with the capability to host more than 1 service providers in any kind of configuration, have not been, and for the most part, not a part of the market in the USA. Dual SIM phones common to most countries outside the USA are foreign to the USA and have always been. Therefore, what this means is that the service plans sold to the public are tailored for 1 phone/line usage. Data only plans that actually work in phones are rare in usage and in offerings. ESIM integration in the USA is at its infancy and is still a niche feature.</p>
<h2 id="most-americans-knowledge-of-anything-besides-the-big-3-is-little-to-none">Most Americans Knowledge of Anything Besides the Big 3 is Little to None</h2>
<p>Most Americans know about the Big 3 and that is about it. That means that any recommendation will likely be more expensive that it needs to be and/or limited in some aspect. They will know the name of maybe 3 or 4 other companies, likely Cricket, Metro, Boost, and maybe Tracfone. But even then, rarely have any knowledge of substance when it comes to these companies. There are 100+ other carriers besides the Big 3 offering service each serving a certain niche.</p>
<p>When it comes to actually purchasing cellular service. Most will say to go to a local retail establishment of that carrier, or a major Big Box retailer. All valid options, though that is likely the extent of the knowledge and advice. Read on to find out why this is bad advice.</p>
<h2 id="just-ask-an-employee-who-works-at--______-they-will-set-you-up">&ldquo;Just Ask An Employee Who Works at  ______, They Will Set You Up&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Employees who work at any major, nationwide, chain, retail, brick-and-mortar store, in my experience, have such limited knowledge of their own companies products, let alone the rest of the market.</p>
<h3 id="the-big-3-brick-and-mortar-stores">The &ldquo;Big 3&rdquo; Brick-and-Mortar Stores</h3>
<p>Most employees (non-manager) who work at one of the Big 3 carrier stores work by the hour and receive commissions based on sales. They receive the most commission on postpaid (not prepaid) activations and accessory sales.</p>
<div class="details admonition info">
        <div class="details-summary admonition-title">
            <i class="icon fas fa-info-circle fa-fw"></i>Want to Know a Secret?<i class="details-icon fas fa-angle-right fa-fw"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="details-content">
            <div class="admonition-content">Every employee hates &ldquo;prepaid&rdquo; customers in these stores</div>
        </div>
    </div>
<p>No one working at the store wants to deal with prepaid customers. If you were to go to one of these stores you will only be given options related to that carrier only (obviously). No employee at one of these stores is going to recommend going to a competitor. Due to a combination of lack of knowledge, not allowed to do so (company policy), and/or the fact that they likely just do not care.</p>
<h3 id="national-big-box-retailers">National Big Box Retailers</h3>
<p>Employees that work at these stores also work by the hour and if they do receive commissions it is likely they receive the higher amounts on postpaid (not prepaid) activations. Likely little to none for prepaid activations. Though these stores will have a larger variety of options in the prepaid space, finding a competent employee who is somewhat knowledgeable enough in their own offerings to give an accurate recommendation is difficult. The wages they work at compared to their workload in other aspects of their job hardly incentivizes them to do more than the minimum when it comes to learning their prepaid options.</p>
<p>Some of these employees are not even employees of that store that they are at. Some retailers contract other companies to handle there phone departments.</p>
<h3 id="similar-sales-practices">Similar Sales Practices</h3>
<p>Employees, regardless of which kind of store they work at. If someone works in mobile phone store or department in the USA for a nationwide retail store, they have sales quotas that they more or less have to meet to stay employed. What this means is whatever recommendation made is influenced by fear of getting fired, greed for more commission/make a livable wage, or confusion over the vast options simply offered by their own employer, let alone the broader marketplace.</p>
<h2 id="mobile-wireless-employees-and-people-in-the-usa-in-general">Mobile Wireless Employees and People in The USA in General</h2>
<p>There are no practical issues in not knowing of something when you are not in need of it or will likely never be in need of it. Having knowledge of the entire wireless market is useless to most people when all their needs are already being fulfilled. The market is at a level where price and service differences is not substantial enough to change.</p>
<p>As much as Americans complain about the Big 3, warranted or not, they are full service and if any issues arise they will take care of it. No knowledge is required to have all your needs met, and when the alternatives are not &ldquo;viable&rdquo; enough to even look their way, why bother?</p>
<h2 id="visitors-to-the-usa-have-different-needs-compared-to-the-locals">Visitors to the USA Have Different Needs Compared to the Locals</h2>
<p>What people visiting the USA want when purchasing a local sim card (whether they know it or not) are, but not limited to&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>GSM/LTE Compatibility (meaning it will work with their existing phone).</li>
<li>International calling/texting credit is a plus, perhaps even mandatory (to call/text back home).</li>
<li>Only pay for service they need/want.</li>
<li>Some semblance of choice (what are their options).</li>
<li>That it works (not having to change providers because of a reason that could have been easily averted).</li>
<li>In-person purchasing options.</li>
<li>Cash acceptance vs debit/credit card only options.</li>
<li>A no-contract prepaid account.</li>
<li>Timely acquisition of the sim card with service activated (the quicker, the better).</li>
<li>NOT to be ripped off when purchasing whatever they decide on.</li>
<li>Perhaps wanting to keep the phone service active to maintain an American phone number after they leave the USA.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-worst-infringement-is-when-a-local-says-you-cannot-purchase-a-sim-card-at-the-airport">The Worst Infringement is When a Local Says You CANNOT Purchase a Sim Card at the Airport.</h2>
<p>It is the most convenient out of all options available and almost all people say you cannot/should not do it. 100% WRONG. A visitor arriving to the USA can absolutely purchase a sim card at the airport. Some might interject and say that it is indeed possible to purchase a sim card at the airport they will proceed to say &ldquo;it is more expensive to purchase a sim card at the airport&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Read the lyroma article about how to buy, possibly the most convenient and best value for the features SIM card, in the USA and at the airport. Not clickbait.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-all-means-to-visitors-to-the-usa">What This All Means to Visitors to the USA</h2>
<p>If you want help or want to learn about your options when it comes to a prepaid service, there is a list of useful websites/forums where these people congregate on lyroma.com//Useful-Sites
The websites listed on that page along with the page itself will be what anyone needs to make a knowledgeable purchase.</p>
