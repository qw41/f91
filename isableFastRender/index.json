Finding, buying, and activating will all be covered here. This article will be about what is most accessible to the maximum amount of international visitors to the USA. The trend seems to be that if anyone asks about purchasing SIM cards at the airport, SPECIFICALLY in the USA, the response will be that it is either “not possible”, “prohibitively expensive”, or “better options outside the airport”. Admittedly, once outside the airport a person will have a much higher variety of products at lower prices. This is true, but it is also true, that some would simply prefer to purchase a SIM card at the airport. Not only have new options arrived but there has been a convenient and affordable option for years. Buying and activating a local SIM card at the airport is THE MOST CONVENIENT option when arriving at any country, aside from having a SIM card with roaming features with you beforehand. The issue is when people ask this question, the people who answer are mostly those who have never tried, never had a reason, and will never have a reason to do so. This topic warranted its own article about the mindset of the “Average” American when it comes to Prepaid Wireless in the USA. The demand for this service is there, as it is there for virtually every other country in the world outside the USA. Another reason someone may want a SIM card immediately (especially one with international calling features) upon arriving is to call back to their loved ones that they landed safely. Not everyone is on Skype or WhatsApp, or the airport Wi-Fi may, uhh… suck. Time to get to the information you came here for.

Currency Exchange Booths This is where you can exchange currencies upon arriving at an airport.

You should buy a lottery ticket immediately afterwards. Currency Exchange Booths are just too inconsistent across the board to be relied upon.

Products offered, customer service, price, and locations available, can all range from awful to excellent. The website of the airport might list some of these stores in their shop directory. It seems to be the best way of finding out if an airport has a certain store in it. Example 1 - The Newark airport in New Jersey lists a kiosk named “SIMs On The Go”. It is listed as “temporarily closed”. Running that name in a online search engine yields little relevant results. No website, no hours of business, no contact phone number, nothing. Example 2 - The LAX airport in Los Angeles lists a “Virgin Mobile/Boost Mobile” kiosk, also “temporarily closed”. They have listed hours and a contact phone number though. Example 3 - The McCarren Airport in Las Vegas lists a “SIM Cards - Vending” (type in “SIM cards” in the search bar and it should appear) vending machine. The only thing known about this vending machine from the listing is the specific location in the airport in which it is located. Nothing more.

Inmotion Stores USA InMotion is an electronics retailer with stores inside airports across many states in the US. They sell LycaMobile and Ultra Mobile SIM cards. These stores are not in some random airports, they are predominantly in airports most frequented by travelers on both international and domestic flights. They include 120+ total locations in 44 airports, 26 states, and Washington DC. InMotion being in “only” 26 states is not as much as an issue as you might think, for example an international arrival is likely not going to fly direct into Alabama. In the case that someone’s final destination is Alabama, they’re likely to transit through one of the airports that does have an InMotion store. Here is a list of locations. This article has always been about what is most accessible to the maximum amount people. InMotion stores at the current moment have everything that the other 2 airport options are lacking. This article will contain a snippet of information about InMotion Stores. To read a full detailed breakdown of Prepaid Wireless options at InMotion Stores, click here. By the time this article is released these options should be at all, if not most locations. Though, it never hurts to double-check and confirm hours and availability before arriving that a certain airport location. Stores do not have the same hours of operation, it’s important to check that the location will actually be open upon your arrival. Especially if you are transiting through that airport and have no time to waste. Click the location finder and select the airport you will be arriving at, then narrow down which terminal you will be arriving at. InMotion does not make it clear which locations are at the “International Arrivals Terminal” and once you past security it can be difficult if not impossible to get past security again. Research on your own which terminal you will be arriving at and check if there is going to be an InMotion store near your arriving terminal. I find https://www.ifly.com/ to be a helpful resource when researching individual airports, their maps, and which terminals are which. Though it is still best to call ahead and confirm that the location is not temporarily closed or anything. If you have any questions about the SIM cards or concerns about availability, do not hesitate to call any one of the locations at the airport you will be arriving at, beforehand. For example, Inmotion stores can share products across locations (within the same airport), so if the location you want to buy the SIM card at is out-of-stock, then with a little notice they can move that SIM to your desired location. The point is, if you will be relying on this then it doesn’t hurt to check beforehand. Also, something to keep in mind, is that the InMotion employees, I’ve found, to be “sufficiently” knowledgeable, when it comes to activating the SIM cards for you if you need help doing so. From my experience, if they attempt to activate the SIM card and fail to get it to work with your phone. They will give you a refund or try again. Your mileage may vary.

The rates you will have to pay will be in addition to your monthly plan rate. Example - For LycaMobile, if you wanted to use your service outside the USA with your $30 plan, then your base cost would be $30 a month + whatever you use on a PAY-AS-YOU-GO basis. The funds for usage internationally must be loaded onto your account before usage. Not recommended for long term or heavy usage, there are better Carriers for such use cases.

Others will finance their phone through some other lending vehicle. When the term is complete they will do one of few things but the end result, usually, is continuing being a subscriber of one the Big 3. Another aspect is most people will make their purchases at some sort of local retail store where the employees with set up everything for the customer, full service.

That 1 phone equals 1 phone number. Some will have a personal cell phone number and business phone number. Some accomplish this by having 2 phones, others, likely have a VoIP solution of some kind. Phones with dual SIMs or a phone with the capability to host more than 1 service providers in any kind of configuration, have not been, and for the most part, not a part of the market in the USA. Dual SIM phones common to most countries outside the USA are foreign to the USA and have always been. Therefore, what this means is that the service plans sold to the public are tailored for 1 phone/line usage. Data only plans that actually work in phones are rare in usage and in offerings. ESIM integration in the USA is at its infancy and is still a niche feature.

That means that any recommendation will likely be more expensive that it needs to be and/or limited in some aspect. They will know the name of maybe 3 or 4 other companies, likely Cricket, Metro, Boost, and maybe Tracfone. But even then, rarely have any knowledge of substance when it comes to these companies. There are 100+ other carriers besides the Big 3 offering service each serving a certain niche. When it comes to actually purchasing cellular service. Most will say to go to a local retail establishment of that carrier, or a major Big Box retailer. All valid options, though that is likely the extent of the knowledge and advice. Read on to find out why this is bad advice.

They receive the most commission on postpaid (not prepaid) activations and accessory sales. Want to Know a Secret? Every employee hates “prepaid” customers in these stores No one working at the store wants to deal with prepaid customers. If you were to go to one of these stores you will only be given options related to that carrier only (obviously). No employee at one of these stores is going to recommend going to a competitor. Due to a combination of lack of knowledge, not allowed to do so (company policy), and/or the fact that they likely just do not care.

Likely little to none for prepaid activations. Though these stores will have a larger variety of options in the prepaid space, finding a competent employee who is somewhat knowledgeable enough in their own offerings to give an accurate recommendation is difficult. The wages they work at compared to their workload in other aspects of their job hardly incentivizes them to do more than the minimum when it comes to learning their prepaid options. Some of these employees are not even employees of that store that they are at. Some retailers contract other companies to handle there phone departments.

If someone works in mobile phone store or department in the USA for a nationwide retail store, they have sales quotas that they more or less have to meet to stay employed.

Having knowledge of the entire wireless market is useless to most people when all their needs are already being fulfilled. The market is at a level where price and service differences is not substantial enough to change. As much as Americans complain about the Big 3, warranted or not, they are full service and if any issues arise they will take care of it. No knowledge is required to have all your needs met, and when the alternatives are not “viable” enough to even look their way, why bother?

International calling/texting credit is a plus, perhaps even mandatory (to call/text back home). Only pay for service they need/want. Some semblance of choice (what are their options). That it works (not having to change providers because of a reason that could have been easily averted). In-person purchasing options. Cash acceptance vs debit/credit card only options. A no-contract prepaid account. Timely acquisition of the sim card with service activated (the quicker, the better). NOT to be ripped off when purchasing whatever they decide on.
