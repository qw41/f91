# Don Silvio, Varsity Blogger?


## This Site is Now Live
I'm going to start posting about Prepaid Wireless topics. 
To start off, most of what I'm going to post about are the things I could not find any "good" resources on. Things that exist but are not so well known, documented, or old enough that it has effectively been forgotten. 

As time goes on I might start posting about other related topics. Subscribe or follow me for updates.

## https://lyroma.com
I will more than happy to respond to comments made on my own blog posts on ***this*** site. This is the way I prefer to talk about the topics I post about.

Personally message me at donsilvio@protonmail.com

**I guarantee nothing if trying to contact me on through other channels.**

Limited interaction on Reddit. I'll try to be helpful. No guarantee.

Twitter will be used to notify about new blog posts. Not much more.

Medium will have short versions of the full blog posts available here. Not much more.

## No Regurgitated Information
This is a far too common practice in today's age. It will **NOT** happen here. Everything posted on this site will be verified by me, firsthand, *no buffers*. Though I warn you, I have no editor or anyone to proofread my blog posts. Typos are expected.

## Contributions Welcome
I'm not doing this to get rich, or to make a living. This blog is a hobby done in my spare time. A little goes a long way here. 

See how you can contribute.

## "This Thing of Ours"
I would not have made a public blog if I wanted to keep this information to myself. Feel welcome to comment on blog posts, I moderate all comments. Please be respectful of not only me but others.
