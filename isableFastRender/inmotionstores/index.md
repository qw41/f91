## Brief Company Profile

Taken straight from their about page,

*"Keeping the Traveler Connected for 20+ Years. InMotion is the travelerâ€™s top destination for electronics on the go.

### InMotion Today 

At the time of the initial posting of this article, according to [InMotion](https://www.inmotionstores.com/about), they currently have "120+ stores". These stores have not been in and are not in some random airports either, they are predominantly in airports most frequented by travelers on both international and domestic flights. They include airports in 27 states and Washington DC.

They are a USA based Company (owned by UK Company, W.H. Smith) and are expanding to more locations, even outside airports.

There are a lot of companies named InMotion, very confusing. Are they called Inmotion, Inmotion Stores, Inmotion Entertainment? If someone knows, leave a comment.

That is about as much as I want to write, I think someone reading this now has decent idea about them as a company.

## SIM Cards Since at Least 2018
![Inmotion Store in IAH George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston](/img/inmotioniahmain.jpg)
 
From at least [March 13th, 2018](https://www.inmotionstores.com/post/what-you-need-to-know-about-traveling-and-sim-cards) and perhaps even earlier, Inmotion has been selling a widely accessible and affordable prepaid wireless option at US airports with Ultra Mobile SIM Cards. On [March 22, 2018](https://www.inmotionstores.com/post/inmotion-wins-coveted-award-for-industry-excellence-at-airport-revenue-news) they reported that they had "125 locations throughout the United States". 

During this period they also offered T-Mobile SIM cards. This has been discontinued.

## SIM LOCAL Partnership

On Jan 13, 2021, SIM Local [announced](https://www.simlocal.com/sim-local-partners-with-inmotion-to-provide-local-sim-cards-across-the-us/) a partnership with InMotion to bring SIM Local SIM Cards into InMotion Stores. 

*"The new agreement will see Sim Local provide a choice of SIM cards and plan options to international travellers looking to stay seamlessly connected while abroad, without incurring additional roaming charges."*

From that snippet, **to me**, it sounded like they might provide more than one Carriers SIM cards. So far I can confirm SIM LOCAL is providing ***only*** LycaMobile SIM cards in InMotion Stores.

I speculated that with this partnership, InMotion would discontinue their offering of Ultra Mobile SIM cards. This has yet to happen, and I have nothing more to say about that.

From at least [March 13th, 2018](https://www.inmotionstores.com/post/what-you-need-to-know-about-traveling-and-SIM-cards) and perhaps even earlier, InMotion has been selling an affordable option at US airports with [Ultra Mobile](https://www.ultramobile.com/) SIM Cards. These stores have not been in and are not in some random airports either, they are predominantly in airports most frequented by travelers on both international and domestic flights. They include 120+ total locations in 44 airports, 26 states, and Washington DC.

The states not covered by Inmotion include
Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming, or any overseas territory. 

I don't see that much of an issue as an international arrival is likely not going to fly direct into Alabama. Even if someone's final destination is Alabama, they're likely to transit through one of the above airports that do have an Inmotion store.
This article has always been about what is most accessible to the maximum amount people. InMotion stores at the current moment have everything that the other 2 airport options are lacking.

### SIM Local Partnership

On Jan 13, 2021 SIM Local announced a partnership with InMotion to bring SIM Local SIM Cards into InMotion Stores. In the press release they said they would "offer [their] products from January 2021"
